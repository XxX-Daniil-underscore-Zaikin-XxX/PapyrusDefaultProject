# Default Papyrus project

A modernized template for Skyrim mods, built with out-of-the-box compatibility with Caprica, Pyro, VSCode, and Actions. This is modding dragged kicking and screaming into the century of the fruit bat.

There are many moving parts, but the [wiki](https://github.com/XxX-Daniil-underscore-Zaikin-XxX/PapyrusDefaultProject/wiki) should explain all - including the installation.

If you encounter any issues with this project or have some suggestions, feel free to make a [new issue](https://github.com/XxX-Daniil-underscore-Zaikin-XxX/PapyrusDefaultProject/issues/new).
