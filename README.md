## About

<table><tr><td>

A modernized template for Skyrim mods, built with out-of-the-box integrations with Caprica, Pyro, VSCode, Actions, and more.

Download source code made with this template, and - with the right tools - get a working mod in less than a minute. Push a commit to your repository, and it'll give back a FOMOD installer ready for sharing. Make full use of GitHub's enterprise-tier source control features, and put it to work on your chores.

This is modding dragged kicking and screaming into the century of the fruit bat.

## Usage

### Installing the source of a mod made using this template

1. Fork and clone the mod's repository
2. Install the Prerequisites
3. Run the `Build All` task
4. Ensure that mod has been properly prepared. This will include: 
   1. No errors in the console
   2. All `.esp` plugins are in the root directory
   3. `Scripts/` in root are filled with `.pex` files
   4. All files in `dist` have been copied into root (e.g. `skse/`, `interface/`)

### Compiling your source

Just run `Build All`. That's it!

If you must perform other build tasks, add them to `tasks.json` and put them into `Build All`'s `dependsOn`. Consider [making a Pull Request](https://github.com/XxX-Daniil-underscore-Zaikin-XxX/PapyrusDefaultProject/compare) for your new task to this template so other people can make use of it!

### Preparing your source for a commit

Before you commit any code, make sure to run the `Prepare Sources` task. It's always a good idea to ensure on every commit that your code compiles and doesn't crash.

### Creating a new release
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Consider using [semantic versioning](https://www.gitkraken.com/gitkon/semantic-versioning-git-tags) (e.g. `v1.3.1`) to name your release versions. It's standard industry practice for many good reasons.

Automated builds let you make releases quickly and often, and it's always a good idea to make your most recent changes as accessible as possible. You can generate a release through GitHub Actions:

1. In the Actions tab, select the `Build Release` workflow in the left pane
2. Click `Run Workflow` in the workflow runs table
3. Fill in your release version and turn on `Publish Release?`
4. Run the workflow and wait for it to finish
5. In the Releases section of your repository, find the newest release (it'll be a pre-release)
6. Edit the details as required
7. Un-check `Set as pre-release` and check `Set as latest release`
